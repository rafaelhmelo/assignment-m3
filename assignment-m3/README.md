# assignment-m3

To start, run "npm run serve"

Notes:

- This is extremely basic. The focus of the 8h was on meeting the requirements.

If given more time, I'd do the following adjustments:

- Refactor the code and split it between multiple files. For example, validation code in one separated file, and separated component files for the email and phone number lists, which are dynamic.
- Add a proper cs compiler like grunt or webpack instead of adding raw css. Setting those up take time, and I'd rather invest it into meeting the requirements.
- Improving styles with tailwind, for example, which would have made styling easier.
